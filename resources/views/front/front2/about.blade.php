                    <p class="stext-113 cl6 p-b-26">
                            Coffee House Cafe is build by two long time Friends that saw an opportunity to build a specialty coffee shop based on their love for coffee, they started to learn more about coffee and also get to know the farmers. After nearly a year of research they finally have the guts to open their shop in a small place in Cipete. They met a lot of coffee lovers, coffee owners, coffee experts, and all the coffee community has helped us to accomplish our dreams.
